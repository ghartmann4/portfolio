# About

I am a pianist and programmer. I recently completed my doctorate in music; my dissertation is ["The Reciprocal Interaction of Musical Performance and Analysis"](https://academicworks.cuny.edu/gc_etds/5754/).

Pianist Greg Hartmann is currently an Artist Diploma student at the Guildhall School, as a student of Ronan O’Hora and Martin Roscoe. Greg has won first prize in the 2023 Knoxville International Piano Competition, first prize in the 2018 Memphis International Piano Competition, second prize in the top division of the 2021 Schubert Club Scholarship Competition, third prize in the 2021 William Knabe International Piano Competition, third prize in the 2019 Thousand Islands International Piano Competition, and third prize in the 2018 High Point University Piano Competition, among others. He has performed concerti with the New Albany Symphony Orchestra, Rochester Symphony, Lakeshore Wind Ensemble, Concord Chamber Orchestra, and Waukesha Area Chamber Orchestra. Also an accomplished composer, Greg won the 2018 Paula Nelson-Guenther Young Composer Competition with his orchestral work Requiem for a Memory: Nocturne for Orchestra. He maintains an interest in music theory, and presented an original research paper at the 2020 conference of the Society for Music Theory. Greg has participated in music festivals including the Aspen Music Festival and School, Pianofest in the Hamptons, the Bowdoin International Music Festival, the Sejong International Music Festival, Euro Music Festival and Academy, and the Gijón International Piano Festival. Greg’s research focuses on the relationship between music performance and music theory, with a particular emphasis on Schenkerian analysis, rhythm and meter, and phrase-level form. In his free time, Greg enjoys tennis, running, and ping pong.
