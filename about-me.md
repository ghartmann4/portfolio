# About

I am a pianist and programmer. I recently completed my doctorate in music; my dissertation is ["The Reciprocal Interaction of Musical Performance and Analysis"](https://academicworks.cuny.edu/gc_etds/5754/).

During my doctorate, I held a Digital Fellowship through the Graduate Center's Digital Initiatives (GCDI). In this capacity, I led workshops on digital skills, held consultations, ran the Python User Group, and helped develop various other projects and initiatives. In the summer of 2024, I taught the GC Summer Python Intensive.

In my free time, I like to build things. Some of my coding projects can be found below! Here you can find [more about me.](./about-me)
