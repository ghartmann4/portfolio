# Parsimony in Microtonal Music

Using a script that I wrote, I demonstrated the existence of parsimonious trichords in music in cardinalities other than 12. [Watch the presentation.](https://youtu.be/nT_NuaeOyCs) Find the code for this project [here.](https://github.com/ghartmann4/parsimony)

Here is Example 1, showing simple parsimonious relationships with the pitch-class integers labelled beneath the score. If we define parsimony based on an absolute distance in acoustic space, we see that the same distance is measured in different number of steps in whatever cardinality "c" we currently reside (hereafter, "c-steps"). The looser requirement allows motions that the stricter requirement does not.

It turns out that under the more restrictive definition of parsimony, trichords that exhibit the parsimonious relationships P, L, and R are only found in cardinalities that are integer multiples of three, while under the expanded version this is not the case.

Why do we typically draw the line between a “step” and a “leap” between a major second and a minor third? David Huron explains this question in his article, “Tone and Voice: A Derivation of the Rules of Voice-Leading from Perceptual Principles”. He suggests that the “fission boundary in effect identifies a psychoacoustic basis for the distinction between conjunct and disjunct melodic motions. What theorists call conjunct intervals are virtually guaranteed to evoke the perception of stream continuation.” “Stream continuation” here refers to perceiving of adjacent notes as a single musical line. This suggests that there is a psychoacoustic basis for treating intervals below a certain size as steps­­ and larger intervals as leaps.

(*) Given a cardinality of c, the expanded option allows motion of up to c/6 steps. Table 1, above, summarizes the allowed voice leading motion under this expanded definition. A key benefit of this expanded definition is that it prevents the motion from becoming imperceptibly small at higher cardinalities. Of course, as c increases, the distance between consecutive pitch-classes becomes smaller. Because of this, it may become more difficult to hear the difference between pitch-classes separated by a single c-step, especially when other notes are interposed between them.
