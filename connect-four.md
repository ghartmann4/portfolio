# Connect Four

![](./assets/img/connect4-regular.png)

This is a connect four game that you can play against an AI opponent. I wrote this game from scratch in a way that allows you to choose the size of the n x m board. The AI opponent plays with a minimax algorithm and uses alpha-beta pruning for efficiency. The depth can be changed easily--at higher depths, the program takes longer to run on each turn, but the computer will play more optimally. Find the code for this project [here](https://github.com/ghartmann4/connectfourgame).

## Minimax Algorithm
A minimax algorithm works by

In practice, a depth of even just 4-5 seems to provide an even match for most human players (at least for my family and friends), and at depth of 7 it plays nearly perfectly.
