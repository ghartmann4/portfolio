# Connect Four

This is a connect four game that you can play against an AI opponent. I wrote this game from scratch in a way that allows you to play on an n x m board of any size. The AI opponent plays with a minimax algorithm and uses alpha-beta pruning for efficiency. The depth can be changed easily--at higher depths, the program takes longer to run on each turn, but the computer will play more optimally.
